Using R to summarisz reports on excel
I have used data from Hospital Charges for Inpatient in the U.S available at data.gov

The dataset shows the variations of hospital charges in the various hospitals in the U.S. for the top 100 diagnoses.It also shows how price for the same diagnosis and the same treatment and in the same city can vary differently across different providers.

The goal of my analysis is to help a prospective client identify the most convinient 
hospital in terms of charges (Covered by medicare) and location .
